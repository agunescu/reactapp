I’ve build an application that allows users to search for Youtube videos. It’s a video player, very similar with Youtube.

I didn't used dummy data for this application, I’ve used YouTube Data API v3
to fetch data. Used this in two steps, I’ve signed up for a key and second I've installed a small package
to help with the search (youtube-api-search). For styling I used bootstrap css.

I’ve build this app using only React, I have also worked on a second app, as much as I could, using Redux.
By building this, I’ve covered numerous React core topics including JSX, components, state. I’ve used ES6 features like
class, arrow functions, import and export statements, template strings.
